A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster using the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset.
The main goal of this project is not just to build an ML model, but to learn how to structure machine learning projects in modular Python code instead of relying only on Jupyter Notebooks.

#Project Goals

Apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML modeling on the Titanic dataset.
Shift from exploratory work in Jupyter Notebook ‚ûù production-ready modular Python code.
Understand how to organize a real-world ML project with clear folder structures.

#Learning Outcomes

How to structure ML code into reusable modules.
Moving from notebooks to scripts for cleaner, scalable workflows.
Building intuition for real-world ML project pipelines.

#Future Improvements

Add hyperparameter tuning
Use cross-validation
Deploy model as a simple web app (e.g., Flask/FastAPI)
